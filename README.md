# Grade-Check-Email
This code creates your grade check email for you.
Here's how it works:
First the code asks for the section that changes everyweek.
Then it opens your grades and takes a screenshot.
It names the picture the date and saves it to a folder called gradeCheckImages.
Then it opens the outlook app (The one on desktop not the website one) and creates a draft with all the info you put in the code.
Then it opens the website where you can find the email draft in your drafts.
You can then check the content before you send it. (make sure you click on the emails so they process that they are the emails.
